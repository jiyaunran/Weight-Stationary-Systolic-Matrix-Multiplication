# Weight-Stationary Systolic Matrix Multiplication

This repository contains a small Verilog project developed for self-learning and skill enhancement during job hunting.

The implemented design is a **weight-stationary systolic array** architecture, which is commonly used to accelerate matrix multiplication in hardware. In this design, weights are kept stationary in the processing elements (PEs), enabling efficient reuse and reducing memory access overheadâ€”especially beneficial when the weights are fixed, such as in AI model inference.

### Features
- **Weight-Stationary Dataflow**: Optimized for low-cost weight reuse.
- **Soft-IP Style Design**: The number of processing elements (mesh size) is configurable via parameters.
- **Square Matrix Multiplication**: Currently supports multiplication of two square matrices of equal size.

### Usage
This project is intended for educational purposes, and as a demonstration of systolic architecture and parameterized Verilog design.
